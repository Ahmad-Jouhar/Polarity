# Polarity

An algorithm and a visualization for Simon Tatham's magnets puzzle, which can be found [here]([url](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/magnets.html)). 

## Usage:
To run all the files, you need to have numpy installed for all of them, and pygame is required for the visual and game files.

You can install the libraries by running the following commands in a terminal:

pip install pygame

pip install numpy

## polarity - algorithm.py

The barebones code with the output shown using the terminal

## polarity - visual.py

The barebones code with a visual representation to show the recursive backtracking (will run slow on larger boards)

## polarity - game.py

A game where you can try to solve the puzzles the algorithm tries to solve.
